# Habitat-Portal: Docusign Good Code Hackathon 2022 Submission

## How to run the app

1. Either download or clone the repository into your local computer
2. Open your command line and redirect to the root project folder
3. run npm install
4. cd into your frontend folder
5. again run npm install
6. go back to the root folder (using 'cd ../' in the command line)
7. run npm start
8. It should be up and running! If you fill out and submit any forms, I'll be the one receiving the emails but you can easily fix that and even create your own app for this project on Docusign's developer account, assign your own config and environment variables, and customize the application to your environment. Enjoy :)
